Write down the contents of your computer’s ARP cache. What is the meaning of each column
value?

Address Resolution Protocol (request)
    Hardware type: Ethernet (1) 
    Protocol type: IPv4 (0x0800)
    Hardware size: 6
    Protocol size: 4
    Opcode: request (1)
    Sender MAC address: Azurewav_5c:b1:13 (74:c6:3b:5c:b1:13)
    Sender IP address: 10.137.147.193
    Target MAC address: 00:00:00_00:00:00 (00:00:00:00:00:00)
    Target IP address: 10.137.146.1

What are the hexadecimal values for the source and destination addresses in the Ethernet frame
containing the ARP request message?
74:c6:3b:5c:b1:13
00:00:00:00:00

Give the hexadecimal value for the two-byte Ethernet Frame type field. What upper layer protocol
does this correspond to?

Ether Type = 0 X 086  ARP 

Questions:

a) How many bytes from the very beginning of the Ethernet frame does the ARP opcode field
begin?

20

b) What is the value of the opcode field within the ARP-payload part of the Ethernet frame in
which an ARP request is made?

00 01

c) Does the ARP message contain the IP address of the sender?

YES

d) Where in the ARP request does the “question” appear – the Ethernet address of the
machine whose corresponding IP address is being queried?

The field “Target MAC address” is set to 00:00:00:00:00:00 to question the
machine whose corresponding IP address (192.168.1.1) is being queried. 

Now find the ARP reply that was sent in response to the ARP request.
a) How many bytes from the very beginning of the Ethernet frame does the ARP opcode field
begin?
The ARP opcode field begins 20 bytes from the very beginning of the Ethernet
frame. 

b) What is the value of the opcode field within the ARP-payload part of the
0x0002, for reply

c) Where in the ARP message does the “answer” to the earlier ARP request appear – the IP address
of the machine having the Ethernet address whose corresponding IP address is being queried?
”Sender MAC address” field.

7. What are the hexadecimal values for the source and destination addresses in the Ethernet frame
containing the ARP reply message?
